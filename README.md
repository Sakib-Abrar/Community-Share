# Community Share
This project was started due to the need of a simple and easy to use file and text sharing service between computers connected in a local network.

Why use community instead of ftp for file sharing? A commonplace for all the common/shared files. Limit access to only the people you want. Want to share text/link? possible and simple. Want to find a previously shared text? easy.

The frontend was built using Angular, Angular Material and Bootstrap 4. The backend uses Spring Boot and Hibernate. There is no raw query so you can MariaDB, MySQL or MSSQl etc with just by changing application.properties.
